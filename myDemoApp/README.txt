Overview:
The idea here is to utilize Docker to provide application and database services, running as logically separate services on the local machine.
With the application and datawarehouse subscribing to a common topic.

To allow for multiple databases and services, each database and service are allocated different ports.  Further, we need to associate each
database to each service.  The docker containers have been named to help identification, e.g.:

C:\Users\npickard\Documents\personal\workspace\myDemoProject\myDemoApp>docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
eb9a1a80c722        java:8u40           "java -jar /docker..."   6 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:8081->8080/tcp   myDemo-DataWarehouse-8081-Db-3307

Note the use of the name to describe the service and port, as well as the db and port the service uses.
